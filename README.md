# Crawling Chimp

Imagine this script as a troop of adventurous chimps exploring the vast jungle of the internet. Each chimp represents a link found on a webpage. They swing from one link to another, shouting with excitement as they discover new paths. Some chimps are slower, taking their time to savor the journey, while others are swift and curious. At the end of their exploration, they compile a list of all the intriguing spots they've visited, much like our script saves the output links to a file. It's a jungle out there, but with this script, your chimps—I mean, links—are in good hands!
